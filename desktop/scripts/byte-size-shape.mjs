/**
 * byte-size-shape.mjs — THE SHAPE RULE for byte-size formatting.
 *
 * WHY A SHAPE RULE EXISTS AT ALL. `check:package-twins` is NAME-based: it fails
 * a local `function formatFileSize`. But the byte-size twins in this repo were
 * never called that. They were `formatBytes`, `fmtBytes`, `humanSize`,
 * `bytesToSize`, `formatSize`, `bytesHuman` — and two dozen more were not
 * functions at all, just `{(file.size / (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2)} MB` inlined
 * into JSX. A name register cannot see any of that. The 2026-09-07 duplication
 * census named this gap in as many words ("the census method needs a shape
 * pass"); the 2026-09-11 re-verification proved it, finding 14+ live twins
 * under names nobody had registered.
 *
 * THE PATTERN THIS DETECTS. A byte count becoming a unit string, which in
 * JavaScript is always the same two things in one expression:
 *   (a) a DIVISION or COMPARISON against 1024 / 1048576 / 1073741824, and
 *   (b) a unit label literal — "B", "KB", "MB", "GB", "TB" (or the KiB/MiB
 *       binary spellings) — within the same short window.
 *
 * A capacity CONSTANT never matches: `80 * 1024 * 1024` multiplies, and the
 * detector requires `/ 1024`, `< 1024`, `>= 1024` etc. That asymmetry is the
 * whole reason the rule is usable — the repo has ~60 legitimate byte ceilings.
 *
 * THE DECIMAL (SI) FAMILY (added 2026-09-11 after a second independent review).
 * Every arm below used to start from a BINARY base — 1024 / 1048576 /
 * 1073741824 — so a body that divides by the SI base was invisible to the whole
 * detector, and five live twins sat in the fleet returning zero findings:
 * `m.value / 1_000_000` + " MB" (cloud-browser telemetry, which has no B or KB
 * tier at all and renders a 4 KB payload as a confident "0.0 MB"),
 * `content_length / 1000` + "KB", `effectiveContent.length / 1000` + " KB", and
 * `bytes_downloaded / 1e6` + " MB". Decimal is not a different capability — it
 * is the SAME capability with a wrong divisor, which is precisely why it must
 * be collapsed rather than tolerated. So the base literal now covers 1000,
 * 1_000, 1e3, 1e6, 1e9, 1e12 and their long spellings alongside the binary
 * three, and EVERY arm inherits the widening because they all read one shared
 * literal pattern.
 *
 * THE MULTIPLY-FROM-GB ARM (added 2026-09-11, same review). One live twin runs
 * the conversion the other way: `matrx-local`'s `fmtSize(gb: number)` receives
 * GIGABYTES and MULTIPLIES — ``return `${Math.round(gb * 1024)} MB`;`` — so no
 * division exists anywhere in the body. Its two collapsed siblings
 * (`Devices.tsx`, `Voice.tsx`) were found by hand, not by this guard.
 *
 * WHY THIS DOES NOT BREAK THE CAPACITY-CONSTANT ASYMMETRY, which is still the
 * whole reason the rule is usable. The multiply arm is narrower than the
 * division arms in TWO independent ways, and a byte ceiling fails BOTH:
 *   1. OPERAND SHAPE. It requires a NON-LITERAL (an identifier or property)
 *      multiplied by the base: `gb * 1024`, `mb * 1024 * 1024`. Every capacity
 *      ceiling in the fleet is literal × literal — `80 * 1024 * 1024`,
 *      `16 * 1024 * 1024`, `64 * 1024 * 1024` — and literal × literal can never
 *      match this pattern.
 *   2. LABEL POSITION. It requires the unit label on the SAME LINE and OUTSIDE
 *      any comment, because that is what "this number is being displayed" looks
 *      like: ``${Math.round(gb * 1024)} MB``. The ±6-line window is deliberately
 *      NOT extended to this arm: `const maxBytes = limitMb * 1024 * 1024; //
 *      25 MB` is a ceiling computed from a variable, and under a window (or a
 *      rule that read comments) it would be indistinguishable from a formatter.
 *      Comments are stripped before the label test for exactly that reason.
 *
 * THE SINGLE-UNIT FORM (added 2026-09-11 after an independent review). The
 * window above assumes the unit label sits near the arithmetic. One whole
 * idiom does not: the conversion is hoisted into a NAMED value at the top of a
 * component and the label is typed into JSX far below it. In
 * `features/flashcards/fast-fire/capture-test/WavePlayer.tsx` the division is
 * on line 58 and the ` KB` is on line 102 — forty-four lines away, invisible to
 * any window a byte-size rule could afford. What IS on line 58 is the unit: the
 * name. `const sizeKb = (blob.size / 1024).toFixed(0)` declares its unit in the
 * identifier, so an identifier ending in a byte unit (`…Kb`, `…KB`, `…MB`,
 * `…GiB`) taking a byte division is a formatter on its own evidence, with no
 * window at all.
 *
 * THE NAMED-BINDING ARM (added 2026-09-11, same review). The unit is not always
 * in the name either. `components/debug/debug-stats.tsx` wrote
 * `setMemoryInfo({ used: Math.round(heap.usedJSHeapSize / 1024 / 1024), … })`
 * on line 41 and rendered `{memoryInfo.used}MB` on line 86 — the key is `used`,
 * which says nothing, and the label is forty-five lines away. So the lane also
 * follows the BINDING: any name a byte division is bound to on that line — a
 * declaration, an assignment, or an object PROPERTY KEY — and then asks whether
 * that name is interpolated anywhere in the same file immediately before a unit
 * label. That is a whole-file question, not a windowed one, which is exactly
 * why the two hoisted idioms were invisible.
 *
 * THE CALL-ARGUMENT ARM (added 2026-09-11, third form of the same review). The
 * label can also be hidden behind a HELPER, in another module entirely:
 * `matrx-local`'s LoraManager wrote `${formatGb(lora.size_bytes / 1024 ** 3)}`
 * — no adjacent unit literal, no unit-named binding, and the " GB" lives
 * inside `formatGb` two files away. But the CALLEE's name carries the unit, on
 * the same line as the division, which is all the evidence needed: a byte
 * division handed to `formatGb` / `toMb` / `asKB` / `humanGb` is a byte-size
 * formatter with an extra hop. Collapsing it means deleting both halves — the
 * conversion AND the helper — because `formatFileSize` takes bytes and returns
 * the unit.
 *
 * THE IDENTIFIER-DIVISOR ARM (added 2026-09-11, fourth form). Every arm above
 * still starts from `BYTE_DIVISOR_RE`, which matches LITERALS. A body that
 * binds the base first — `const k = 1024; … return `${(bytes / k).toFixed(1)}
 * KB`` — divides by a name, so the lane skipped it entirely; matrx-frontend's
 * `InlineUploadArea` carried exactly that, printing "NaN undefined" for a NaN
 * size, and it escaped the NAME register too because it was spelled
 * `formatBytes`. So the detector first reads the file for identifiers bound to
 * a byte base (1024, 1048576, 1073741824, or `1024 ** n`) and then treats a
 * division by one of those names as a byte division. The EVIDENCE requirement
 * is unchanged — a unit label nearby, a unit-carrying name, or a unit-named
 * callee — so `const k = 1024; const chunks = size / k` with no unit anywhere
 * stays silent.
 *
 * THE ONE HOME is `formatFileSize` from `@ai-matrx/kit/format`, which owns the
 * display decisions (binary units, one decimal below ten in a unit, whole bytes
 * below 1 KB, em-dash for unknown — never a confident "0 B").
 *
 * Exported as a module so `check-package-twins.mjs` can run it as its shape
 * lane and so the self-test can plant a body and prove it fails.
